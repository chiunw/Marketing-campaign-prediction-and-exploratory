# Marketing-campaign-prediction-and-exploratory

## Project Introduction
This is an in-class project that we undertook to learn about building prediction models, performing feature selection, preprocessing data, addressing imbalanced datasets, and story-telling. The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Kaggle open dataset repository.

## Business Settings
Website XYZ offers both free and premium services. The premium customer is more valuable for the company. Less than 1% conversion rate of free to premium, partly due to inefficient marketing strategy, which targets everyone. We will propose a data-driven marketing strategy that targets potential subscribers and reduces marketing costs.

## Analysis Goal
We built a decision tree model that predicts whether a user is likely to subscribe. Using this, we can identify valuable features of potential subscribers and systematically target them in the next marketing campaign. 

## Analysis Results
Our proposal can potentially help Website XYZ to boost the proportion of correctly target potential subscribers by approximately 8% in their next marketing campaign.
